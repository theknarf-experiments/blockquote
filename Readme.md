# Blockquote

A replacement for the built in MacOS Notes app, built as a Electron app around ckeditor5.
Inspiration from [bear](http://www.bear-writer.com/) and [Caret](https://caret.io/).

## MVP

- [x] ckeditor5 with converting to markdown

- [x] electron app packager

- [ ] creating and deleting notes

- [ ] saving notes to disk

- [ ] simple git integration

- [ ] Go through [this list](https://blog.dcpos.ch/how-to-make-your-electron-app-sexy) with tips for making electron apps.

## Nice to have

- [ ] todo type lists

- [ ] image support

- [ ] code blocks w/ syntax highlighting

- [ ] omnibar similare to Sublime Text and Caret, for searching and jumping files.

## Ideas to look into

- Could [texlive.js](https://github.com/manuels/texlive.js/) be used to build pdf documents?

- Could [xterm.js](https://github.com/sourcelair/xterm.js) be embedded in documents?

- How about [jsMath](http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/)?

- [Yjs](http://y-js.org/) looks interesting.
